# JavaFileServer
A simple Java File Server!

# Description
A modular file server written in Java organised in order to be easily exendible due to its modular design.
An instance of the file server consists of a pair of main components, both easily changeable, a request handler and a command executor.
The request handler simply receive commands from a user and passes them to the command executor which effectively perform operations on file server files.

# Build
Compile server or client executing `mvn packge` in the root folder (for the server) or in clients/client (for the server).

# Usage
On Linux only you can use `./server.sh` or `./clients/client/client.sh` to execute the server or the client.

On different OS you can easily replicate these scripts that simply call `java` with the .jar generated by the applications.
